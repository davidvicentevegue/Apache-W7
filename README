****** File configurator for fast apache & PHP 5 install at W7 ******

At this repository we found an customizate httpd.conf for a fast install of apache server 2.2 in W7 & PHP 5
, through this configuration file:

1. Install apache's *.msi from Apache at this custom directory: C:\appserv\Apache2.2
2. Install php 5* (only download the zip file and extract) from PHP at this custom directory: C:\appserv\php5
3. Copy the file "httpd_w7.conf" to the following directory C:\appserv\Apache2.2\conf\ and rename it to "httpd.conf"
4. Stop and restart apache server.
5. That's all folks ;-)

*note: be sure of download the apropiate version of php that works with apache. This version must be compiled with
VS6 and packed liked that: "php-5.2.17-Win32-VC6-x86.zip" (Thread Safe version), because versions compiled with VS9
or higher don't work with apache
